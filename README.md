# libgens-sonicglvl-lostworld

This is a modified branch of DarioSamo's SonicGLvl for editing Sonic Lost World files. The main functionality addition is the ability to read and write .orc set files. There is also functionality to display splines from .path2.bin files, and other smaller changes to improve rendering and make working with Lost World stages a bit easier.

This branch will likely not be further updated, because Lost World support will be implemented natively into the main SonicGLvl branch in the future once the Qt5 rewrite is underway; most of the editor-side code in this branch would need to be scrapped.
